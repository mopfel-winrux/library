- implement foreign scrying for available books on a given resource
	- when /books/[rid] is scried, return a list of all top level nodes on given book

- add %request-book local poke to facilitate subscription flow
	- only allow self to poke this poke
	- poke foreign graph store with %get-book
	- receive graph store update in return (should still be in our +on-agent)
	- also set up subscription %watch

- implement %remove-comment
- implement %get-book



- local poke tests
	- [x] %add-library
	- [x] %add-book
 	- %remove-book
		- [x] book is removed
		- [ ] book is removed from `readers` state
	- [ ] %remove-library
		- [x] library is removed
		- [x] policy is removed from `readers` state
		- [ ] every prim per ship has the rid of the library cleared

- remote poke tests
	- ~nus dojo -> poke %get-book -> ~zod library-proxy
		- [ ] fails because it wasn't from app %library-proxy
	- ~nus dojo -> poke %request-book -> ~nus library-proxy -> poke %get-book -> ~zod library-proxy
		- [ ] should create new subscription wire for ~nus watching ~zod's library-proxy
		- [ ] ~zod should pass graph update of requested book back to ~nus on new subscription as a %pass
		- [ ] ~zod should send all further updates to ~nus now
	- ~nus comment successfully on book on ~zod/library1
	- ~nus cannot delete ~zod's comment
	- ~zod can delete ~nus's comment
	- ~nus can delete his own comment
