--------

may 29

- broadcasting graph updates seem to work!! this was the last major roadblock
- scries only work locally!??
	- remote scrying doesn't exist
	- make %request-libraries poke, which responds with a poke back %libraries or smtn which is the result of /x/libraries
	- make %request-books poke, which server responds back with scry /x/books/@

- still need to forward rest of the updates (implemented, needs testing)
- still need to test out other policies
- will just test locally to make sure code works for a 3rd ship, but not necessary to document
- (side question) how do i manually close a subscription from dojo? %leave?
	- answer: debug poke that runs a %leave

jun 5

- most of the tests run and pass
- need to fix handling readers
	- move state handling to first part of :_, just have another switch/if statement, modify state there,
	- refactor repetative stuff out into |^ arms.

- need to fix breaking changes to graph store validators
- need to do final testing, esp. of update forwarding for non-%add-nodes

jun 9

- all test cases seem to work
- sending a remove graph update seems to net 2 remove graph store updates on receiving end? not a deal-breaker but eh
- sending stuff like %add/remove-signatures needs to be tested eventually, but not a deal breaker.

todo
- filter the %get-libraries scry based on policy, so as not to leak libraries you're not supposed to know about
- test out requesting your own library and book, and do something, see if it causes a loop. currently this is not asserted against
- test out state removal properly working across multiple resources (works for a single one)

nice to haves (will only do if time budget allows)

- sending stuff like %add/remove-signatures needs to be tested eventually, but not a deal breaker. we can skip this until someone complains lol
- allow revising the metadata of a book. forgot about this lol.
- give back the title and/or isbn of the book as well, rather than simply the book's indicies.

- filtered the %get-libraries scry based on policy
