--------

may 29

- broadcasting graph updates seem to work!! this was the last major roadblock
- scries only work locally!??
	- remote scrying doesn't exist
	- make %request-libraries poke, which responds with a poke back %libraries or smtn which is the result of /x/libraries
	- make %request-books poke, which server responds back with scry /x/books/@

- still need to forward rest of the updates (implemented, needs testing)
- still need to test out other policies
- will just test locally to make sure code works for a 3rd ship, but not necessary to document
- (side question) how do i manually close a subscription from dojo? %leave?
	- answer: debug poke that runs a %leave
